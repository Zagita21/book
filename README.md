# The CosmWasm Smart Contracts Book

A book about writing Smart Contracts for CosmWasm using Rust

## About

This repo contains source code for [The CosmWasm Book](https://cosmwasm.github.io/book/).

## Building

The book was built using [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook).

To build it yourself, you'll need to install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) first.

Then install `mdbook` using cargo:

```bash
$ cargo install mdbook
```

and finally build the book itself from within this directory:

```bash
mdbook build
```

For more info about using mdbook read its own [book](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html).
